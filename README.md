- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently coding programs in good old vanilla JavaScript that run on the browser (fetching some API, some DOM, some wierdly long functions and always listening to the user's actions like a maniac would do.) and sometimes code simple windows apps in C++. Oh, and also  I write a lot of CSS and some basic SQL.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: --More and more and more details on above languages-- but also working on ------> Node.js, C#(.NET), PHP, Python, Java, mongoDB, Express.js, Angular, TypeScript, Linux, computer architecture and hardware. (.NET is fine working with even if I need to google everyhing every second of every minute of every hour BUT Angular and TS are giving me a lot of headache. ERROR that ERROR this and ERROR of an ERROR of another ERROR. I'm gonna be good at'em promise that to future me but currently getting a lot of version errors whenever I code something).
